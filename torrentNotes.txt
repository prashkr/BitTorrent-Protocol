Notes:
1) Right now it won't work if the torrent client is restarted because we are using uploadInfo[filename][s] and here socket object i.e s will be lost once the client is closed. It would be better to have s.getpeername() as the index. And we can have each element of it as a tuple i.e (bitvector, socket). So we can update socket when the client connects again to that peer.

2)






To Do:
1) bitVector on disk.
2) updating bitVector as pieces gets downloaded
